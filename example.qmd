This is a different change added on main branch to create a conflict.

This line was added on testbranch to practice branching.


## Introduction

This guide provides a step-by-step demonstration of collaborative and reproducible workflows using Git, GitHub, the command-line interface, and Quarto in RStudio.

## 1 - Creation of a RStudio Project

To begin the assignment, I started by setting up a new RStudio project. I did this by going to File \> New Project \> New Directory. I named the project ETC5513-Assignment-2.

Once my project folder was ready, I created a Quarto document. I set HTML as the output format and typed my name as the author. I basically didn’t make any other changes because the goal here was just to check if I could knit it properly.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/qmd_setup.png")
```

I saved this document as example.qmd, clicked Render, and it successfully rendered into example.html.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/knitted_file.png")
```


## 2 - Initialising Git Repository and Push to GitHub

After setting up my Quarto document, I moved on to version control setup using Git. And once i had my local repository ready, I logged in to GitHub and created a new repo called ETC5513-Assignment-2.

I used these commands for connecting to git repo. - git remote add origin - git branch -M main - git push -u origin main

After that I checked my GitHub repo and saw that all my files had appeared there. This confirmed that my initial commit was now pushed successfully.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/repo_push_ss.png")
```
## 3 - Creating testbranch, Editing of example.qmd, and Push to GitHub

After completing my push on the main branch, I created a new branch called testbranch using git *checkout -b testbranch* command.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/testbranch_ss.png")
```

Then, I opened example.qmd and added this line just below my qmd setup:

“This line was added on testbranch to practice branching.”

After that, I pushed test branch to GitHub and confirmed that new line was added in the qmd file. 
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/testbranch_update.png")
```
## 4 - Adding Data Folder and Amend Commiting it on testbranch

With my testbranch pushed, I moved on to adding the data folder required for this assignment.

I created a new folder named data in my project and placed my Assignment 1 files inside it.

After adding the folder, I staged it. And instead of making a new commit, I amended my last commit to include the data folder. I then force pushed this amended commit to GitHub using these commands :

*git add data*
*git commit --amend --no-edit*
*git push --force*

I thereafter visited GitHub, switched to testbranch, and confirmed that the data folder was now visible online.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/data_folder.png")
```
