## Introduction

This guide provides a step-by-step demonstration of collaborative and reproducible workflows using Git, GitHub, the command-line interface, and Quarto in RStudio.

## 1 - Creation of a RStudio Project

To begin the assignment, I started by setting up a new RStudio project. I did this by going to File \> New Project \> New Directory. I named the project ETC5513-Assignment-2.

Once my project folder was ready, I created a Quarto document. I set HTML as the output format and typed my name as the author. I basically didnâ€™t make any other changes because the goal here was just to check if I could knit it properly.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/qmd_setup.png")
```

I saved this document as example.qmd, clicked Render, and it successfully rendered into example.html.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/knitted_file.png")
```
